# Unit Testing notes

- Prevent bugs 
* static types : Flow/TypeScript
* Lint: ESlint
* Testing: ??

- What is a Unit Test?
- function testing 
* Ex. name matching function

- What is an Integreation Test?
* does the component integrate into the system?

- End to End test

Focus on Unit testing then integration then E2E

E2E the cost of it is really high
