# React Lesson

- Fast way to create a react app

npm install -g create-react-app

create-react-app name-of-this-project

- JQuery uses document.ready, the react index.js is similiar and puts it into the html

- you surround things in curly braces to escape jsx and use javascript you use { } 

- every component has props. props is whatever it receives from the parent component

- anything(data) that is going to change you keep track of it in state

- contructor: we create our state

- super is something that is setting up your app
    * Contructor component will never be activated

- setState changes the state and we have to pass in an object (this)

- bind will return the function def of the old function and it changes the context of 'this' for you
